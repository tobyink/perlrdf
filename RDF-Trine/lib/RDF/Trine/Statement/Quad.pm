=head1 NAME

RDF::Trine::Statement::Quad - an RDF statement plus a graph URI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Constructor

=over

=item C<< new($s, $p, $o, $g) >>

=item C<< new({ subject => $s, predicate => $p, object => $o, graph => $g }) >>

Constructs a quad statement.

=item C<< from_sse($string) >>

Alternative constructor.

=back

=head2 Attributes

=over

=item C<< subject >>

A node representing the subject of the statement.

=item C<< predicate >>

A node representing the predicate of the statement.

=item C<< object >>

A node representing the object of the statement.

=item C<< graph >>

A node representing the graph of the statement. (This is not restricted
to L<RDF::Trine::Node::Resource>.)

=back

=head2 Methods

This class provides the following methods:

=over

=item C<< type >>

Returns the string "QUAD".

=item C<< construct_args >>

Returns a list of arguments that, passed to this class' constructor, will produce a clone of this algebra pattern.

=item C<< clone >>

Returns a clone of this argument.

=item C<< nodes >>

Returns the subject, predicate, object and graph nodes as a list.

=item C<< node_names >>

Returns "subject", "predicate", "object" and "graph" strings as a list.

=item C<< as_string >>

Returns this statement as a string. (Currently in SSE syntax.)

=item C<< sse >>

Returns this statement as an SSE string.

=item C<< has_blanks >>

Returns true if the statement contains any blank nodes. (In fact, returns
the number of such nodes in scalar context, and a list of those nodes in
list context.)

=item C<< referenced_variables >>

Returns a list of the variable names used in this algebra expression.

=item C<< definite_variables >>

Returns a list of the variable names that will be bound after evaluating this algebra expression.

=item C<< bind_variables(\%bound) >>

Returns a new algebra pattern with variables named in %bound replaced by their corresponding bound values.

=item C<< subsumes($other) >>

Returns true if this statement will subsume the C<< $other >> statement when matched against a triple store.

=item C<< to_triple >>

Returns an L<RDF::Trine::Statement::Triple> with the same subject, predicate
and object as this statement, but no graph.

=item C<< rdf_compatible >>

Returns true if and only if the statement can be expressed in RDF. That is,
the subject of the statement must be a resource or blank node; the predicate
must be a resource; and the object must be a resource, blank node or literal.

The graph is completely ignored.

RDF::Trine::Statement::Triple does allow statements to be created which cannot
be expressed in RDF - for instance, statements including variables.

=item C<< as_ntriples >>

Returns the statement as an NTriples string, ignoring the graph.

=item C<< as_nquads >>

Returns the statement as an NQuads string.
